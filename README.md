Have you ever waited in line at an airport that felt too small for the number of flights it handles? Or walked through a massive empty airport and wondered if all that space is really necessary? This project aims to answer these questions using a data-driven approach.

**Objective**: Analyze airport data and flight data from airports around the world and train a machine learning regression model to predict the expected number of daily/weekly flights based on airport type, size, country, location, and altitude. By comparing the model predictions with actual flight activity, we can identify airports which are busier/quieter than expected.

**Deliverable Goals**: A global map highlighting airports with disproportionately high or low flight activity, giving insights into where infrastructure and resources may be under- or over-utilized, informing potential planning or investment decisions.

**Data sources**: OurAirports.com (global airport data), OpenSky Network (daily/weekly flight activity data), OpenFlights.org (airports and flight activity), https://www.adsb.lol (open source flight tracking data)
